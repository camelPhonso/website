            <h4>Personal Intro</h4>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Alphonso, a poet, short-story writer, lyricist, and now, starting as a coder.
            </p>
            <h4>My career so far</h4>
            <p>
                When I arrived in London, 7 years ago, I had little experience but found opportunities in the capital and got started in a carrer managing different service industry businesses. Around 2019, I made the move into HR (only, we call it 'People' nowadays). The learning experience was great, but I'm ready for a different kind of challenge.

            <h4>Why I'm applying to Founders and Coders</h4>
            <p class="learning">
                I recognised in my habitual ways of working an iterative approach to problem solving and a taste for the kind of task others often find tedious (like handling data, or setting up new company-wide systems) and I wondered what different career path might be out there that I would enjoy. Luckily, I was exposed to the work of the Web Developers at my last job, and a spark came to life.
            </p>
            <p class="learning">
                I started studying on my own by mid September 2022 and quickly got hooked. This is the kind of stimulating challenge I enjoy meeting with and it was easy for me to understand that web development was the next step in my career.
            </p>
            <p class="learning">
                I started looking at Bootcamps that might help me make the leap and came across Founders and Coders. It seemed perfect for me and, because there is no time like now, I got started on the application challenges. They definitely pushed my learning to a new level.

                Here on the right is a piece of code I particularly enjoyed developing during my application.

                I knew I'd need to complete the actions in this function several times when interacting with the "movie data" challenge, so I wanted to design it in a way that would allow me to simply call the function at any point. This challenged me to take a more functional approach to this object-based challenge. I also learned a whole lot about DOM that I hadn't even breached before. I actually ended up going back to the "comment box" challenge and changing the code there to use my new learnings.<br>
